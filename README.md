# README Generator
  
This application uses the NPM package [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to generate a README file based on a user's provided input about their project. It creates the structure of the README file, inserts the provided input in the correct sections, and retrieves a hyperlinked license badge, if the user chose to cover their project under a license. It also generates a link to the user's Github profile page, based on their input of their Github username. It thens writes the content to a file called "README.md" for easy use in the user's repository.
